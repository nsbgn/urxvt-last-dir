# urxvt-last-dir

Spawning a terminal in the same directory as the working directory of the 
current foreground process is quite useful. In `vim`, this is doubly so when 
combined with [vim-rooter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-rooter). However, 
environments are subtly different: are we running under X or Wayland? Is the 
terminal emulator a single instance application? Is the process wrapped in 
`tmux`? Is the foreground process correctly identified?

### Perl extension

[remember-last-dir.pl](remember-last-dir.pl) and 
[open-last-dir.pl](open-last-dir.pl) are Perl extensions for `urxvtd`+`urxvtc` 
that track the **last open terminal**. The original script is courtesy of 
RaphaÃ«l Medaer, as published at 
<https://raphael.medaer.me/2019/06/21/urxvt-open-current-wd.html>. It has been 
extended to use the current directory of the **foreground process**, rather 
than the current directory of the parent shell. To use, copy or link the 
scripts to the `~/.urxvt/ext/` directory, then add the following line to your 
`~/.Xresources`:

    URxvt.perl-ext-common: remember-last-dir.pl

Once you have restarted `urxvtd`, invoke with `urxvtc -pe open-last-dir.pl`.

instead, which is a tiny shell script that produces the working directory of 
the **focused** terminal.
